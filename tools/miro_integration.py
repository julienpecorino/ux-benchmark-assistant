        start_y (float, optional): Starting Y position on Miro board (default: 0)
        max_images (int, optional): Maximum number of images per batch (default: 20)
        batch_number (int, optional): Which batch to upload (1 = first batch, 2 = second batch, etc.)
    
    Related Settings (configurable via configure_settings_tool):
        - image_width: Resize images to this width before upload (default: 600px)
        - image_spacing: Gap between images (default: 100px)
        - layout: "horizontal" (side-by-side) or "vertical" (top-to-bottom)
    
    Returns:
        str: Success message with upload details and next batch info if applicable
    
    Examples:
        - upload_images_tool("Willow")  # Upload first 20 images at default position
        - upload_images_tool("MyApp", batch_number=2)  # Upload second batch of 20 images
        - upload_images_tool("MyApp", max_images=10)  # Upload only 10 images
